# Vladislav-Stelmakh-BrainForce-test-task
PriceList parser

## Attention
Test task is located on the task branch

You need to clone git repository to your IDE and import pricelist.sql to database. That's why I used MySql Server PhpMyAdmin and I can't push db to the github. But application won't work without database. The executive file of this project is back-end.php
